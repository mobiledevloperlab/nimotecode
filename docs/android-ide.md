# Android IDE for SSH, Git and AI Coding

Android can be more than a device for checking servers. With the right tooling it becomes a practical environment for development work: connect over SSH to your own development machine, open the repository, make a focused change and verify it — all from a phone or tablet.

NimoteCode is an **Android IDE** built around that workflow. It combines an Explorer, code editor, SSH terminal, Git review, LSP, debugger and AI Chat and Agent in one mobile workspace, so Android becomes a practical way to keep working on projects that still live on your desktop, laptop or server.

## What an Android IDE should do

An Android IDE should keep the whole loop in one place: understand the project, edit a file, run a command, preview the result and review what will ship. That is different from a standalone code editor for local files, and different from an SSH client that only shows shell text. The project, the terminal and the Git history belong to the same workspace.

## When it is useful

- You are away from your laptop and need to investigate or fix a service.
- You want to review a diff and ship a small change from a phone or tablet.
- You connect to your Mac, Linux box or server over SSH and want the editor and Git view next to the terminal.
- You want AI help that reads the real project instead of a pasted snippet.

## How NimoteCode fits

Connect to your development machine with an [SSH workspace](/docs/ssh) and select the project root. The project stays on the remote host; files and terminal output travel over the SSH connection, so you never need to sync a copy to the device. For a project stored on the device, the local Explorer works the same way.

## A real workflow on Android

1. Save an SSH profile for your development host and open the project root.
2. Find the relevant file in Explorer instead of memorising paths.
3. Make the smallest safe change in the editor.
4. Run the relevant test, build or log command in [Terminal](/docs/terminal).
5. Inspect the [Git changes](/docs/source-control) before you commit or hand off.
6. Ask [AI Chat and Agent](/docs/ai) to explain code or plan the next step when needed.

## Features relevant to Android development

- **SSH workspace** — remote project browsing and editing with reconnect-aware handling.
- **Editor** — tabbed editing with split panes on larger screens and mobile-keyboard-friendly input.
- **Terminal** — command sessions with project context and output search.
- **Git** — inspect status, diffs and history; gated write workflows with Pro.
- **AI Chat and Agent** — workspace-aware assistance with confirmation-oriented execution.
- **LSP and Debug** — language servers and debug adapters configured on the remote host.

## Limitations of an Android IDE

Android cannot replace a desktop for every task. Heavy local compilation, long multi-file refactors and multi-monitor debugging are still more comfortable on a computer. Remote work over SSH depends on a stable connection to the host, and the host does the heavy lifting — a phone cannot compensate for an underpowered server. NimoteCode targets the focused, high-value moments: fixes, reviews, on-call work and small features.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can you do real development on an Android phone or tablet?

Yes, for a focused set of tasks. With an Android IDE like NimoteCode you can connect over SSH to a development machine, browse the project, edit files, run terminal commands, review Git changes and use AI assistance — especially for fixes, reviews and small features.

### Is NimoteCode available on iOS too?

NimoteCode is available for Android on Google Play and for iPhone and iPad on the App Store.

### Can Android run heavy local builds or full IDEs?

Not the same way a desktop does. Long local compilation and large multi-file refactors are better on a desktop; on Android, remote development over SSH to your existing machine is usually the productive path.
