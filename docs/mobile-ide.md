# Mobile IDE for SSH, Git and AI Coding

Most mobile coding tools solve one part of the job: open a file, connect to a server, or run a command. A **mobile IDE** should keep the whole development loop together: explore the project, understand the code, make a change, verify it, and review what will ship.

NimoteCode is a **Mobile AI Development Workspace** for that loop. The Android and iOS releases bring an Editor, Explorer, SSH, in-app web and media preview, Terminal, Git, AI Chat and Agent into one workspace. On supported Android devices, Local Linux also provides a bundled Ubuntu environment with Bash, Git, and SSH without root access.

## What makes a mobile IDE useful for real work?

| Need | A single-purpose app | NimoteCode workspace |
|---|---|---|
| Understand a project | Open individual files | Browse the project in Explorer and keep files in tabs |
| Work remotely | Switch between an SSH app and editor | Connect to an SSH workspace and work on its files |
| Validate a change | Copy commands into another app | Run commands in the workspace terminal |
| Preview a web change | Switch to a separate browser | Open a local or remote web project from the workspace or a Terminal URL |
| Compare related code | Flip between files | Keep two files visible in split editor panes |
| Ship carefully | View a raw diff elsewhere | Review Git changes next to the edited code |
| Get help | Paste snippets into a separate AI chat | Use AI Chat or AI Agent with workspace context |

The goal is not to replace a desktop for every long coding session. It is to make the moments when you only have a phone or tablet productive: an on-call investigation, a small production fix, a review while travelling, or an AI-assisted follow-up to work already in progress.

## A complete workflow, without app hopping

Start in Local Explorer when the project is on your device, use Local Linux when you need bundled Ubuntu on a supported Android device, or connect through [SSH Workspace](/docs/ssh) to a remote development machine or server. From there, open files side by side in the editor, preview the current HTML contents before saving or open a local or remote web project when needed, run tests or inspection commands in [Terminal](/docs/terminal), and use [Source Control](/docs/source-control) to inspect the resulting diff.

When a task needs more context, [AI Chat and Agent](/docs/ai) can explain code or plan a change. AI Agent is designed for controlled multi-step work; in an SSH workspace it can also use a configured compatible external ACP runtime. You can inspect what it proposes and keep the final decision in your hands.

## Built for mobile constraints

Good mobile development is not desktop UI squeezed onto a small screen. NimoteCode is designed around touch, mobile keyboards, focused panels and reconnect-aware remote work. The current release also makes long sessions steadier with more resilient SSH handling, bounded preview resources, and more reliable mobile terminal input. On a tablet, the larger display gives you more room for split editing, project navigation and terminal output; on a phone, the same workspace stays focused on the next action.

For feature details, see [Features](/features). For a concrete production scenario, see [Remote Hotfix from Mobile](/use-cases/remote-hotfix). For setup instructions, start with [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start).

## Where the desktop still wins

A mobile IDE is a complement, not a full replacement. Long, uninterrupted feature work, heavy local compilation, extensive multi-file refactors and multi-monitor debugging remain better on a desktop. On a phone, focus narrows naturally to the next concrete step: inspect, edit, verify, review. That division of labour is why remote development over SSH — reusing the computing power you already have — is usually the productive path instead of trying to compile large projects locally on a phone.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is NimoteCode just an SSH client?

No. NimoteCode combines Editor, Explorer, SSH, Terminal, Git, AI Chat and Agent in one mobile development workspace.

### Can I work on a remote project from a phone or tablet?

Yes. Connect through SSH, inspect files, edit code, run terminal commands and review Git changes in the same workspace.

### Is NimoteCode available for Android and iOS?

NimoteCode is available for Android on Google Play and for iPhone and iPad on the App Store.
